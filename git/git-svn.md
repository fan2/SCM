NAME
       git-svn - Bidirectional operation between a Subversion repository and Git

SYNOPSIS
       git svn <command> [<options>] [<arguments>]


DESCRIPTION
       git svn is a simple conduit for changesets between Subversion and Git. It provides a
       bidirectional flow of changes between a Subversion and a Git repository.

       git svn can track a standard Subversion repository, following the common
       "trunk/branches/tags" layout, with the --stdlayout option. It can also follow branches and
       tags in any layout with the -T/-t/-b options (see options to init below, and also the
       clone command).

       Once tracking a Subversion repository (with any of the above methods), the Git repository
       can be updated from Subversion by the fetch command and Subversion updated from Git by the
       dcommit command.

SmartGit combines the best of both worlds: the power of a **local Git repository** with the access control of a central **Subversion server**.
